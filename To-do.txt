To-do list 

- expand labeling of drug sets
- visusally inspect where the clusters are tighter. potentially make algorithym to determine that either on a euclideun space or on one dimensional. 
	- one dimensionsal might also be worth to then measure the distance from the origin/center

- do something similar / do a box plot for the samples of the scores/variates of the samples on each components to try and explain what is going on (bar plots, sup figure 6b)


Push analyses to the drug desert/forest section
		-One of the strongest parts of the paper
		- Check for positive controls
		- Try with PLS-C, rCCA, any other method that performs
	-With which ever analysis/analyses work, check if ferroptosis can be seen on any components and repeat that analyses
	-Investigate leukemia
	-Look to see if removing blood cancers or any others could rescue the “aesthetics” of the original plots

- Improve the GSEA/pathway analyses
- Improve metric/presentation of how well functionally similar genes/drugs are clustering
- Investigate how other drug data sets could help us (PRISM, GDSC)
